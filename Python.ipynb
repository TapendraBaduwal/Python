The advantage of being interpreted language, it makes debugging easy and portable.\n","\n","- Python is a very high-level programming language because its syntax so closely resembles the English language. Higher-level means itâ€™s more readable to humans and less readable to computers. Likewise, Lower-level means less readable for humans and more readable for computers.\n","\n","- Python supports object-oriented language and concepts of classes and objects come into existence.
