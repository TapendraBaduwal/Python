Python is an interpreted language; it means the Python program is executed one line at a time. The advantage of being interpreted language, it makes debugging easy and portable.


Python is a very high-level programming language because its syntax so closely resembles the English language. Higher-level means itâ€™s more readable to humans and less readable to computers. Likewise, Lower-level means less readable for humans and more readable for computers.


Python supports object-oriented language and concepts of classes and objects come into existence. It supports inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation, etc. The object-oriented procedure helps to programmer to write reusable code and develop applications in less code.
